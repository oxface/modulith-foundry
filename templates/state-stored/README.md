# FoundryApplication

Consumer-owned .NET 10 / PostgreSQL application, rooted at `ConsumerRoot`. Catalog owns
the editable `ICatalogQueries` contract and its state-stored item names. The host supplies
ordinary native DI composition. There is no runtime dependency on the creation tool.

## Build and run

```sh
dotnet build FoundryApplication.slnx
dotnet run --project src/FoundryApplication.Host
```

The default command only prints instructions. It does not connect, migrate, seed, start
workers or establish an actor/tenant. Invalid commands and missing migration configuration
exit with code 2. This is a small adoption executable, with no production business ingress.

Provision a PostgreSQL 18.6 database separately; supply its connection string through
`CATALOG_CONNECTION_STRING`. Then explicitly apply the module-owned migration:

```sh
dotnet run --project src/FoundryApplication.Host -- migrate
```

This creates only `catalog.items` and `catalog.__EFMigrationsHistory`, and seeds no data.
The module's native provider registration, schema, migration and history location are editable.
To scaffold a later change, restore the pinned native EF tool and use the design-time factory:

```sh
dotnet tool restore
dotnet ef migrations add YourChange --project modules/Catalog/FoundryApplication.Catalog --startup-project src/FoundryApplication.Host
```

## Executable Catalog journey

Set `CATALOG_TEST_ADMIN_CONNECTION_STRING` to a **disposable local PostgreSQL server** with
permission to create/drop databases. The tests create a fresh database, run the real host
before initialization, explicitly migrate, seed two tenants with native saves/transactions,
and call `ICatalogQueries`. They drop their own database in `finally`.

```sh
dotnet test --project tests/FoundryApplication.Adoption.Tests
```

The journey checks exact module tables, migration/model consistency, no implicit startup
initialization or migration seeding, tenant-isolated reads, rejected foreign inserts, and a
detached forged-owner update rejected by the stored-owner concurrency predicate. Four
additional cases reject missing actor, missing tenant, anonymity and deliberate tenantless
execution before database access.

The **test-only** system identities and tenant selection represent already completed
consumer authentication/admission. They are not an authentication implementation. Before
exposing business operations, the consumer must authenticate callers or trusted work,
map canonical identities, admit the selected tenant, authorize the capability, initialize
both segments once in a fresh operation scope, and only then invoke the contract. The host
contains no request-supplied identity path or demo authentication scheme.

## Library adoption and obligations

`libraries/` contains local source snapshots of three existing libraries, with their stable
namespaces unchanged. `library-sources.json` records SHA-256 hashes of every copied source
and project file. `foundry.json` records creation configuration. All project references
stay inside this repository; external NuGet restore is still required. Nothing is published.
Review/update these snapshots explicitly; automatic upgrades and package distribution are
future work. Library source receives the generated root build/package settings.

ActorIdentity and Tenancy are independent package-free immutable scoped contexts. Presence
checks grant no authority. Catalog wires separate read/initialization interfaces to the
same scoped holder and requires both established contexts before reading. Establishment
must finish before parallel business work; DbContext itself is not thread-safe.

EF ownership supplies a named filter, tracked-write validation and a stored-owner concurrency
predicate. `CatalogDbContext` explicitly calls validation from both save overrides; the
consumer supplies owner values and owns the final save/commit. Ordinary ownership changes
are rejected. Only ordinary unshared single-table string ownership is used here. Bulk/raw
SQL, disabled query filters, identity-map lookups, privileged operations and arbitrary
same-process code need consumer safeguards. Ownership does not detect competing same-tenant
edits; add a separate version policy if needed. No cross-module transaction is demonstrated.

Authentication, tenant admission, business Contracts, database provisioning, seeds, saves,
transactions, retries, cancellation/failure presentation and any exposed transport remain
consumer responsibilities. There are no event-sourcing or messaging packages, registrations,
migrations or workers in this composition. HTTP adapters, Access lifecycle, OIDC, Aspire,
provider options and repository updates are not supported creation choices.
