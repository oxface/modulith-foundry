# Rootbolt.Auditing

Explicitly stage consumer-selected audit envelopes in the owning native EF transaction.
[The EF package](Rootbolt.Auditing.EntityFrameworkCore/README.md) contains the complete
public surface, setup and obligations. [The transactional contract](docs/transactional-audit.md)
covers lifecycle and deferred capabilities.

`Rootbolt.Auditing.EntityFrameworkCore` depends on existing
ActorIdentity values and native EF Relational. It needs no Tenancy, Persistence, Events,
EventSourcing, Messaging, web, transport, hosting or provider package. Native DI remains
consumer setup; no registration abstraction or unused DI package is added.

[The optional PostgreSQL package](Rootbolt.Auditing.EntityFrameworkCore.Postgres/README.md)
adds `ConfigurePostgresAudit` with JSONB details mapping, keeping provider setup out of
the owning DbContext. The relational mapping includes the tenant/type/item/time/ID timeline
index by default. Ownership and native index customization remain consumer configuration.

Executable consumers are the Wholesale Sales profile mutation and Inventory inbox stock
issue. The independent `tests/AuditPostgresTests` executable adopts the same interface in an
ordinary tenantless EF context with custom mapping. Run it from the repository root:

```bash
dotnet test --project src/Rootbolt.Auditing/tests/AuditPostgresTests/AuditPostgresTests.csproj
```

PostgreSQL is the exercised provider. [E9 execution evidence](../../docs/reports/e9-explicit-transactional-audit.md)
is separate from archived audit evidence. Classification, authorization, required-audit
selection, disclosure, query visibility and retention remain consumer-owned.

The sample's scoped `SalesAudit` and `InventoryAudit` wrappers capture actor/tenant from the
established accessors, generate the entry ID, sample the clock and classify the minimal
business payload. Named V1 payload records keep their schema constants beside their fields;
business callers supply only the accepted change. The audit envelope has no
correlation, causation or trace fields; diagnostic telemetry and messaging metadata remain
separate. The explicit library envelope is usable independently of the sample conventions.
