# Persistence family

Optional native EF Core ownership filtering and explicit protected-write validation.

This directory groups source, documentation and library tests. Each package retains its own
public contract and dependencies; the family is not an umbrella runtime package.

| Package | Responsibility and dependencies |
| --- | --- |
| [Rootbolt.Persistence.EntityFrameworkCore](Rootbolt.Persistence.EntityFrameworkCore/README.md) | References only EF Core Relational; consumer-selected ownership property, named equality filter and native concurrency predicate. |

[Current capabilities, consumer obligations and deferred context](docs/capabilities.md)
explain composition. Follow the selected package's README for explicit setup and errors.
The [executable consumer](../../samples/Wholesale/PersistenceDemo/README.md) demonstrates adoption.

Library tests:

- [EntityFrameworkCoreTests](tests/EntityFrameworkCoreTests/EntityFrameworkCoreTests.csproj)
- [PersistenceTests](tests/PersistenceTests/PersistenceTests.csproj)

Run commands from the repository root. Restore/build the active solution, then test a selected
project under this family's tests directory with `dotnet test --project <path> --no-build --no-restore`.
PostgreSQL suites require a supported local container runtime. Repository-wide architecture
checks remain in [tests/ArchitectureTests](../../tests/ArchitectureTests/ArchitectureTests.csproj);
shared PostgreSQL test support remains repository-owned. See [development commands](../../docs/development.md).
