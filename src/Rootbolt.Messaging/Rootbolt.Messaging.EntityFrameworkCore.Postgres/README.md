# PostgreSQL transactional outbox

References the Messaging EF layer and native Npgsql EF. No RabbitMQ/Rebus transport or
business contract dependency. PostgreSQL is explicit: incompatible provider/model setup
fails when resolving the producer/dispatcher, before publication.

```csharp
// In the module's native OnModelCreating:
model.ConfigurePostgresOutbox("inventory", "outbox_messages");

// In both native save overrides, before base:
this.ValidateOutboxChanges();

// Native context registration remains consumer-owned.
services.AddPostgresOutbox<InventoryDbContext>();
services.AddPostgresOutboxDispatcher<InventoryDbContext, InventoryPublisher>(
    new OutboxDispatchOptions(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30), TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5)));
```

Producer and dispatcher registrations are independent and scoped. The publisher/options
are bound to the specified context, not a global IMessagePublisher. Each context owns one
outbox table; modules can use separate schemas/table names. Existing tenant ownership/filter
utilities can protect TenantKey explicitly; tenantless rows are also supported.

Producer journey:

```csharp
await using var transaction = await database.Database.BeginTransactionAsync(cancellationToken);
// Decide/change business state using native concurrency predicates.
outbox.Enqueue(message);
await database.SaveChangesAsync(cancellationToken);
await transaction.CommitAsync(cancellationToken);
```

Dispatch uses an independent context with no pending business changes, native/enlisted or
ambient transaction. It owns short ReadCommitted claim and completion/retry transactions.
FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED skips locked candidates; a fresh lease token, database-clock expiry
and attempt increment are committed before publication. Completion or retry requires the
same token, undispatched status and an unexpired lease. Stale publishers cannot complete or
defer a successor's claim. No database transaction/row lock is held during network work.

Publisher failure schedules the configured database-time retry and rethrows. If retry SQL
also fails, AggregateException preserves both errors. Cancellation/abandonment and completion
failure leave retained claims recoverable after expiry; publication may already have succeeded.
RetryDelay may be zero; LeaseDuration must be positive. No hidden producer or transport retry.

The schema has a stable GUID primary key, JSONB payload, optional tenant key, database-generated
queued/available timestamps, dispatched timestamp, lease token/expiry and long attempts.
Consumer migrations create/update it. The candidate index excludes dispatched records;
retention still belongs to a later capability. Retain the fixed column/key/JSONB/default mapping;
schema/table names and ownership/filter configuration are customizable.
JSONB preserves JSON meaning, not original text formatting, property order or numeric spelling.
JsonElement is used for an owned opaque payload; no JSON query abstraction is provided.

Dispatch deliberately executes privileged table-wide SQL across owners; query filters do
not authorize that operation. Restrict invocation and grant the host appropriate database
permissions. A publisher needing tenant business access establishes a different admitted
scope. This dispatcher does not impersonate each owner or infer trust from the payload.

At-least-once delivery requires continued dispatch, accepting transport and retained records.
Duplicate effects remain receiver-owned. There is no FIFO, global concurrency cap, lease
renewal, poison policy, pruning, redrive or exactly-once promise. See the
[supported and deferred contract](../docs/capabilities.md) and actual
[Inventory RabbitMQ publisher](../../../samples/Wholesale/EventPersistenceDemo/InventoryRabbitMqPublisher.cs).
