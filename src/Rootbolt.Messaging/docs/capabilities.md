# Messaging capabilities and remaining work

O1 supplies one bounded transactional-outbox capability. [Family setup](../README.md)
and the three package READMEs define the public surface; [the O1 proposal](../../../docs/plans/outbox1-transactional-dispatch.md)
records owner review and [the report](../../../docs/reports/outbox1-transactional-dispatch.md)
records dated executions. O1 is owner-approved at checkpoint `2d7a865` and merged as
`beafa4e`. I1 adds independently selected durable intake and separate transactional processing.
Its [interface/scope](../../../docs/plans/inbox1-durable-intake-processing.md) is owner-approved;
the implementation is checkpointed as `ecab884`, refined as `863456b` and merged as `0f4d8bf`.
[Inbox setup and guarantees](inbox.md) and
[the fresh execution report](../../../docs/reports/inbox1-durable-intake-processing.md) describe the current contract.

## Current composition

Each module selects its own typed DbContext, schema/table, business/integration contracts,
publisher and optional worker. A state-stored adopter needs no event sourcing or context
libraries. An event-sourced adopter enqueues deliberately, alongside facts and the required
inline aggregate. Rebuild/replay does not publish old effects. Producer SaveChanges and Commit
remain explicit; the separately invoked inbox processor owns its local save/completion/commit. Atomicity does not replace concurrency predicates protecting business decisions.

Enqueue preserves the producer's native isolation. ReadCommitted is the sample baseline;
RepeatableRead/Serializable commit/rollback are exercised separately. Native serialization
errors (including Npgsql's transient-failure wrapper) propagate; consumers retry the whole
decision in a fresh context when appropriate. No package escalates isolation or introduces
a universal Rootbolt transaction scope. Multiple DbContexts require explicit native shared
connection/transaction setup to coordinate; O1 supports one owning producer context.

Dispatch commits a lease before transport work and fences completion/retry with its token
and expiry. Expiry may allow a successor to publish while the old publisher is still running;
fencing protects database completion, not external exactly-once effects. Best-effort ordering
does not imply FIFO or a global backlog-empty assertion. Recovery tests use real PostgreSQL;
they do not certify arbitrary providers or abrupt process-kill behavior.

JSONB round trips preserve JSON values rather than original lexical form. The immutable
envelope owns a JsonElement clone. Consumers may use direct native JSON or independently
adopt Events.Serialization for names, schemas and upcasting. The dispatcher neither infers
CLR types nor upgrades queued payloads. Reader-before-writer rollout and payload meaning stay
consumer-owned; event history and delivery lifecycle remain different records.

Optional TenantKey lets consumers reuse Persistence's ownership/filter/save utilities.
Tenancy admission is not supplied or mandatory. Carrying an organization in JSON or a header
does not authorize access; receiver code must validate the trusted producer/tenant mapping.
Dispatch is a privileged module-table operation, with no per-message tenant rebinding.

The optional sequential worker only invokes dispatch in fresh scopes, logs operational
failures and delays/cancels cooperatively. Transport configuration, route declarations,
connection lifetime, confirms/acknowledgements, startup/setup, scaling and permissions remain
consumer-owned. The RabbitMQ sample uses persistent publication, confirmation tracking and
mandatory routing; HTTP demonstrates a different documented acceptance condition.
Neither sample implies successful downstream business completion.

## Contract terminology and integration obligations

The three packages generate XML documentation alongside their assemblies, including envelope
fields, operation outcomes, timing options and registration responsibilities.

- RouteKey is a logical routing key chosen by the producer. IMessagePublisher maps it to
  native transport targets: the HTTP sample maps exports.render to its configured receiver;
  Inventory maps inventory.stock-issues to its RabbitMQ route. No router or topology manager
  is supplied. MessageName and SchemaVersion identify the wire payload contract independently
  of routing; a CLR class name is not automatically the wire name.
- TenantKey is optional opaque tenant metadata. Inventory uses its admitted Organization
  key as a tenant key and composes the existing persistence ownership guard. The independent
  HTTP adopter omits it. The messaging package itself does not interpret it, admit tenants,
  bind execution context or include it in the outbox primary key.
- NoWork means no row was currently claimable, not an empty backlog. Published means transport
  acceptance and a committed outbox completion. ClaimLost means publication returned normally
  but the claim expired or changed before completion could be recorded. Failures throw;
  successful dispatch does not prove downstream business processing.
- ValidateOutboxChanges is an explicit tracked-save guard. Native transaction atomicity and
  dispatcher claim fencing do not depend on calling it. However, omitting it removes protection
  against tracked edits/deletes, envelope changes and saving new work in a different transaction.
  It is required wiring for the documented tracked-write contract, not an automatic interceptor.
- The provided record contains only durable data. An internal weak registry attaches the
  original envelope/transaction and context lease to each enqueued row instance for validation.
  Evidence survives failed saves and same-context detach/reattach; a different context or later
  pool lease cannot adopt it. The weak table does not itself keep row objects alive. There is
  no new registration, save callback or immediate cleanup guarantee.
- Producer/dispatcher constructors inspect native EF model metadata; this may build/cache the
  model but does not query the database, open a connection or require applied migrations.
  Register/configure the context first. Dispatch checks transaction/change-tracking conditions
  at operation time and discovers database/schema availability through its actual SQL.

The samples show application responsibilities: ExportRequestCommands handles an ordinary EF command;
StockPositionCommands handles Inventory commands through its event store; StockIssueMessages
maps an accepted decision to one integration envelope. None is a library-provided handler.

OutgoingMessage.FromPayload<TPayload> accepts explicit JsonSerializerOptions and returns a
non-generic immutable envelope. Serialization captures the value at construction; subsequent
payload changes do not change queued JSON. Already serialized payloads continue using the
constructor directly. No payload generic argument propagates into EF, dispatch or publishers.
The CLR members RouteKey and TenantKey map to the existing destination/owner_key SQL columns.

A publisher may implement a database handoff as its transport. It must commit receiving intake
before returning acceptance; the sender can still fail to record completion and repeat delivery.
Receiving deduplication remains necessary. No database-handoff runtime is provided in O1.

## Durable inbox intake and processing

The owner approved a retained incoming queue with independently selected tables/registration:

1. Consumer receives a complete integration envelope, validates its trusted origin and
   persists a unique intake identity/payload in the receiving module's native transaction.
2. After that commit, acknowledge the broker. Commit-before-ack failure can redeliver; intake
   recognizes the retained identity and does not queue duplicate work.
3. Callable processing and an optional worker invoke explicitly registered handlers in fresh
   scopes. Local business effects, processing completion and newly produced outbox work must
   commit together. I1 holds a native row lock through bounded local
   processing rather than using an expiring claim; external effects are outgoing work.

The receiving module owns its context and commit independently of the sender. A native
RabbitMQ two-module sample proves rollback without ack and committed intake before ack
failure. PostgreSQL and consumer proofs additionally cover duplicate/racing intake, handler
failure/recovery, connection-loss rollback and fresh-context processing. This becomes a useful service-splitting pattern without a distributed transaction.
A local durable handoff adapter can be compared later.

MessageId identifies one delivery and must remain stable on retry. Define deduplication
scope explicitly: receiving module/handler identity matters when one delivery fans out.
CorrelationId groups a workflow/conversation; CausationId identifies its immediate cause.
They remain useful, but multiple legitimate messages can share them. They must not deduplicate
different deliveries. Semantic operation IDs/fingerprints are another consumer-owned policy.
Reused delivery identity with incompatible content requires an explicit conflict decision;
never silently treat it as an equivalent duplicate. The current Inventory adapter illustrates
correlation by stock position; it does not invent causation when no incoming command ID exists.

The archived inbox records a processed receipt with business effects; it is historical
evidence for the simpler model, not proof of queued intake/processing. Do not implement both
modes automatically. No generic acknowledgement facade is selected: ack is transport-specific
and belongs after the applicable database commit. Broker tags/channels and native failure
semantics remain visible in the sample. Additional helpers must earn their interface.

## Deferred capabilities

Separate worker hosts are possible with the existing Hosting abstractions; current API
placement is sample composition. Multi-process deployment/recovery proofs and richer durable
tracing are planned in the [remaining roadmap](../../../docs/plans/remaining-capability-roadmap.md)
and [observability proposal](../../../docs/plans/durable-message-observability.md).
No W3C trace context is currently retained by the envelope/rows.

New-service snapshot/feed repopulation is a distinct planned capability. Current dispatch
ordering and retained delivery rows do not provide a safe replay cursor or snapshot boundary.
A producer-owned replay/export contract, retention rules and transactional receiver progress
need separate proof; no bootstrap runtime is supplied. Durable workflows likewise begin with
module-owned state and the existing messaging contracts, not an implemented saga engine.

Receipt-only mode if an adopter needs it;
queued-message compatibility/upcasting rollout proofs; retention/deduplication windows;
identity-preserving redrive; poison/attempt-cap policy; lease renewal; parallel/batch dispatch;
per-stream ordering; other DBMS providers; additional transports and local module handoff;
encryption/secrets; richer tracing/initiator propagation; durable workflows; cross-module
transactions; template messaging presets. Event-sourcing maintenance/async projections remain
in their owning family. These capabilities need specific failure/consumer evidence, not only
more interfaces. There is no required Rootbolt root runtime.
