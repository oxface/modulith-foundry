# Native EF messaging composition

References Messaging and native EF Core Relational, DI, Hosting and Logging abstractions.
No Npgsql, broker, Events, EventSourcing, Persistence or Tenancy dependency.

`IOutbox<TDbContext>`/`EfOutbox<TDbContext>` enqueue a provided `OutboxMessageRecord` in the
caller's explicit native transaction. They do not save, commit, dispatch or open a producer
transaction. DbSet declarations are optional; use native Set<OutboxMessageRecord>().

`ConfigureOutbox(model,schema,table)` supplies the relational shape; provider configuration
must specialize payload/time storage. Use [ConfigurePostgresOutbox](../Rootbolt.Messaging.EntityFrameworkCore.Postgres/README.md)
for the currently supported runtime. No second provider is certified by this base mapping.

Call `ValidateOutboxChanges()` before base in both SaveChanges(bool) and
SaveChangesAsync(bool,CancellationToken) overrides. It checks that added rows came from enqueue
in the same native transaction and rejects envelope/lifecycle mutation or deletion through
tracked EF writes. Technical initial timestamps are database-generated. No base context or
automatic interceptor installs these obligations. Omitted guards, bulk/raw SQL and external
writers are outside this contract.

`IOutboxDispatcher<TDbContext>` supplies one separately callable dispatch operation.
NoWork means no eligible row was claimed at that moment; Published means acceptance plus
guarded completion; ClaimLost can follow successful acceptance and permits later delivery.

Optionally register `AddOutboxWorker<TDbContext>(new OutboxWorkerOptions(idleDelay,failureDelay))`
after a concrete dispatcher and native logging registration. It starts no migrations and
discovers no modules. Each sequential invocation gets a fresh async scope, disposed before
waiting. Dependency/model/provider failures during resolution fail startup/execution;
publication/storage failures are logged and retried with failureDelay. IdleDelay applies on
NoWork; both delays must be positive and within native Task.Delay bounds. Cooperative host
cancellation stops new work and reaches the publisher. A non-cooperative publisher can still
hold shutdown; leases do not forcibly terminate code. Callable dispatch requires no worker.

Inbox composition is independent: IInbox<TDbContext> retains delivery in a caller-owned
native transaction; IInboxProcessor<TDbContext> owns the separate processing save/commit.
AddInboxHandler<TDbContext,THandler>(subscriptionKey) binds a consumer-owned scoped handler
through native keyed DI. The handler stages bounded local effects on that context, including
optional outbox work. It does not commit or perform external effects. No public lease or
prepared-message handle is introduced. AddInboxWorker<TDbContext>(subscriptionKey,options)
is separately selected and uses fresh scopes, native logging and cooperative cancellation.

ConfigureInbox supplies relational mapping, specialized by ConfigurePostgresInbox for the
supported runtime. Call ValidateInboxChanges in both save overrides: tracked inserts/edits/
deletes of provided records reject. Native intake/completion owns lifecycle SQL; no inbox weak
registry or transaction field is needed. DbSet properties are optional.

Keep domain eligibility, whole-operation retry, tenant admission and deployment policy with
the consumer. Producer/intake final save/commit remain explicit; the processor owns its bounded
local processing transaction. See [inbox setup](../docs/inbox.md) and
[complete obligations](../docs/capabilities.md).
