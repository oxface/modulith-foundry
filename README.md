# Modulith Foundry

Rootbolt is a set of opt-in .NET libraries usable independently in APIs and workers.
This repository develops them against an executable modular-monolith sample and provides
a consumer-owned application template. Consumers own their application composition, module
policy, transactions, transport routing, and worker deployment.

The reusable libraries use `Rootbolt.*` namespaces, project names and assembly names.
The repository, sample applications and template retain their existing identities.
See [the rename report](docs/reports/rootbolt-library-renaming.md) for the scope and verification.

Library families own their package source, documentation and library tests. Each package is
independently selectable; a family folder does not add an umbrella dependency.

| Family | Packages |
| --- | --- |
| [ActorIdentity](src/Rootbolt.ActorIdentity/README.md) | Core and optional ASP.NET Core adapter |
| [Tenancy](src/Rootbolt.Tenancy/README.md) | Core and optional ASP.NET Core adapter |
| [Persistence](src/Rootbolt.Persistence/README.md) | EF Core ownership utilities |
| [Events](src/Rootbolt.Events/README.md) | Independent serialization and history utilities |
| [EventSourcing](src/Rootbolt.EventSourcing/README.md) | Aggregate core and optional EF Core write store |

The [state-stored template rehearsal](docs/plans/t1-template-rehearsal.md) is owner-approved
and checkpointed as `8ccf4c8`. Its [creator](tools/template/README.md) generates an independent
Catalog/console repository with configurable naming and three existing library source
snapshots, without event or messaging dependencies. [The report](docs/reports/t1-template-rehearsal.md)
records the supported creation behavior and limits.

[ES1 bounded event append](docs/plans/es1-library-write-store.md), checkpointed as `ab85ec9`, adds reviewed aggregate bookkeeping
and a provided IEventStore write coordinator to the optional native EF event segment.
State-dependent Inventory issues and an independent history/direct-JSON counter exercise it.
Explicit native save guards validate registered required-state participation. Consumers keep
domain rules, view definitions and native save/commit. Existing event experiments and T1's event-free output
remain intact. See [the store slice report](docs/reports/es1-library-write-store.md) and
[the current plan](docs/plans/library-extraction.md).

The original wholesale sample and its documentation are preserved under
[`archive/proof-sample`](archive/proof-sample). They supply behavioral evidence and known
limits for deliberate reimplementation, rather than prescribing the new library design.
The first active segments are independent [actor identity](src/Rootbolt.ActorIdentity/Rootbolt.ActorIdentity/README.md)
and [tenancy](src/Rootbolt.Tenancy/Rootbolt.Tenancy/README.md), exercised by [the finite wholesale context sample](samples/Wholesale/ContextDemo/README.md).
The first [EF ownership utility](src/Rootbolt.Persistence/Rootbolt.Persistence.EntityFrameworkCore/README.md)
was checkpointed with an executable Inventory consumer. The
[two-module persistence sample](samples/Wholesale/PersistenceDemo/README.md) now owns native
Inventory/Sales migrations and separate histories checkpointed as `f2dcf2b`.
Same-tenant customer/address relationships were checkpointed as `d67c7fc`.
Versioned profile changes with caller-owned transactions were checkpointed as `6069c05`,
completing the initial E2 persistence scope. The optional
[actor HTTP adapter](src/Rootbolt.ActorIdentity/Rootbolt.ActorIdentity.AspNetCore/README.md) and
[HTTP identity sample](samples/Wholesale/HttpIdentityDemo/README.md) were reviewed and
checkpointed as `faefc0b`. The independently adoptable
[tenancy HTTP adapter](src/Rootbolt.Tenancy/Rootbolt.Tenancy.AspNetCore/README.md) and Organization-scoped
catalog sample were reviewed and checkpointed as `cfbac9a`, including explicit selection
presets and a native host-filter options utility. Persisted Access lookup and membership
admission were checkpointed as `20a02be` in [E3.3](docs/plans/e3-3-persisted-access.md), with
[real PostgreSQL evidence](docs/reports/e3-3-persisted-access.md).
[E3.4](docs/plans/e3-4-persisted-business-ingress.md) was checkpointed with E3.5 as `31c7a8b`: admitted
requests read tenant-owned Inventory data through separate module/Contracts projects, with
[actual database and architecture proofs](docs/reports/e3-4-persisted-business-ingress.md).
[E3.5](docs/plans/e3-5-profile-mutation.md) adds protected, versioned Sales profile edits.
[E3.6](docs/plans/e3-6-runtime-composition.md) adds an editable
[Aspire AppHost](samples/Wholesale/AppHost/README.md), explicit setup, readiness and native
telemetry, checkpointed as `28ee797`. [E3.7](docs/plans/e3-7-oidc-browser-journey.md) implements
optional local Keycloak, explicit application account mappings and real browser journeys,
checkpointed as `dc3ac3b` with [implementation findings](docs/reports/e3-7-oidc-browser-journey.md).
[E4](docs/plans/e4-event-serialization.md) implements the independent
[Events.Serialization library](src/Rootbolt.Events/Rootbolt.Events.Serialization/README.md), immediately
used by a [two-family consumer](samples/Wholesale/EventCodecDemo/README.md), with
[fresh proofs](docs/reports/e4-event-serialization.md) checkpointed as `2a49ef3b`.
[E5.1](docs/plans/e5-1-event-history.md) adds independently adoptable
[ordered-range validation](src/Rootbolt.Events/Rootbolt.Events.History/README.md) with explicit two-family
hydration, owner-reviewed and checkpointed as `4cc12a1`. [Its report](docs/reports/e5-1-event-history.md)
separates memory-only proofs from database guarantees.
[E5.2.1 native EF reads](docs/plans/e5-2-1-native-event-history.md) adds owning Inventory/Purchasing
modules and an [executable database consumer](samples/Wholesale/EventPersistenceDemo/README.md),
owner-reviewed and checkpointed as `4f4d5b2`. [Its report](docs/reports/e5-2-1-native-event-history.md)
records PostgreSQL selection/isolation/capture proofs. The owner-reviewed
[E5.2.2 append slice](docs/plans/e5-2-2-native-event-append.md) adds explicit command staging
and caller-owned transactions before views and messaging. [Its report](docs/reports/e5-2-2-native-event-append.md)
records real PostgreSQL conflict/rollback proofs; no new library mechanism was needed.
[E5.3 storage registration](docs/plans/e5-3-event-storage-registration.md) adds
[EventSourcing.EntityFrameworkCore](src/Rootbolt.EventSourcing/Rootbolt.EventSourcing.EntityFrameworkCore/README.md),
adopted by both modules and an [independent shared-table consumer](samples/EventStorageDemo/README.md).
E5.2.2 and E5.3 were checkpointed together as `abcd370`;
[the storage report](docs/reports/e5-3-event-storage-registration.md) records
fresh tenant-free/customized/mixed-stream proofs and preserved module schemas.
[E6.1](docs/plans/e6-1-inline-decision-state.md) implements inline decision state and
required views in both modules, checkpointed separately as `1ae13d4`. [Its report](docs/reports/e6-1-inline-decision-state.md)
records atomic view updates and editing without history replay; no new library mechanism was proven.

## Development

The SDK, formatter, editor settings, Lefthook, and Conventional Commit tooling remain
pinned in the repository. Install the existing repository tools with:

```bash
dotnet tool restore
npm ci --prefix tools/repository
npm exec --prefix tools/repository -- lefthook install
```

Run the active sample with:

```bash
dotnet run --project samples/Wholesale/ContextDemo/ContextDemo.csproj
```

CI checks active architecture, context, HTTP identity, EF models, event codecs and history,
with separate PostgreSQL ownership and Aspire runtime composition lanes. Repository checks
verify formatting, commit messages and archive checksums. Archived builds/tests are excluded
from CI and commit hooks; their files remain available as historical reference material.
