# ADR 0012: durable diagnostic context and native telemetry

Status: accepted interface/scope decision, 2026-10-10; implementation awaits final owner review.

## Context

Separate producer/intake/processing lifetimes proved by W1 cannot share ambient process
context. Business delivery/conversation/cause IDs survive persistence, but cannot reconstruct
a trace relationship. Native RabbitMQ instrumentation can inject a different send context
on each publication, including repeated delivery of the same retained message.

## Decision

Retain explicitly supplied optional W3C TraceParent/TraceState on incoming/outgoing envelopes
and provided durable rows. These are diagnostic metadata, separate from business identities
and admission. Core remains BCL-only; no ambient capture or mandatory OTel runtime is added.
Malformed diagnostic parents cannot reject otherwise valid business work.

Exclude diagnostic context from inbox duplicate comparison and keep the first committed
intake's context. Include it in immutable outgoing-envelope validation. Consumers apply
additive nullable-column migrations; library registration does not migrate databases.

Instrument existing callable PostgreSQL dispatch/processing with native ActivitySource and
Meter. Link retained context at activity creation; use distinct attempts while preserving a
local ambient parent. Record observed completion outcomes and bounded operation/result
metrics. Optional native ILogger logging occurs while the attempt activity remains current.
SDKs, subscriptions, exporters, sampling, transport headers and monitoring policy belong to
editable hosts/adapters. No shared Rootbolt host/telemetry framework is selected.

The internal native trace/metric mechanism resides in the package-free messaging core.
Explicit friend access lets the PostgreSQL assembly use it without exposing a new public
API. The operation implementations own generated failure logging and the placement of
attempt boundaries. ILogger dependencies stay with those operations/hosted workers rather
than the core. Operation failures and native Npgsql/EF database diagnostics are distinct.

The owner-approved optional `Rootbolt.Messaging.OpenTelemetry` adapter provides
AddRootboltMessaging overloads on the native trace and metric builders. Its sole dependency
is OpenTelemetry.Api. It subscribes to the existing names without configuring providers,
SDKs, exporters, sampling, logging or transport sources. Technical messaging packages
remain independently adoptable without this convenience adapter.

## Consequences

Fresh processes can recover diagnostic relationships without changing transaction ownership,
at-least-once publication or delivery/business idempotency semantics. Trace context can differ
across retries without becoming an inbox conflict. Compiled consumers rebuild for the optional
constructor additions, and existing databases migrate before using the updated model.

Backlog observations/alerts, dashboard UX, baggage, automatic tenant/actor propagation and
durable telemetry remain separate capabilities. [Local setup/limits](../../src/Rootbolt.Messaging/docs/observability.md)
and [the OBS1 report](../reports/obs1-durable-message-observability.md) distinguish mechanism,
consumer policy and fresh results from prior worker/archive evidence.
