# ADR 0009: Module-owned transactional outbox and independent dispatch

Status: owner-authorized interface/direction, 2026-10-08. Implementation remains subject
to line-by-line review; no commit approval is implied. [Reviewed scope](../plans/outbox1-transactional-dispatch.md).

Each adopting module owns its typed native DbContext, schema/table, business contracts and
transaction. Explicit enqueue joins that context's existing transaction; business changes,
events/required aggregate state where applicable, and outgoing work share the caller's
save/commit. No universal Rootbolt unit of work or mandatory context/event dependency is added.
Different modules receive/commit independently, preserving a future service boundary without
assuming a distributed or shared cross-module transaction.

The Messaging family has a provider-free envelope/publisher contract, used EF record/mapping/
enqueue/save/worker code, and PostgreSQL-specific model/claim/completion SQL. PostgreSQL uses
JSONB and its own clock/lease semantics. The EF layer is not a promise of supported dispatch
on another DBMS; no public SQL dialect or lease repository is introduced. Transport implementations,
routes, confirmations and receiving acknowledgements remain consumer source.

Callable dispatch owns short native ReadCommitted transactions. Commit a token/expiry claim
before publication, publish without a database transaction, and fence completion/retry with
the same unexpired token. External acceptance cannot be atomically committed with the completion
write. Delivery may repeat with stable identity; receiver idempotency remains necessary.
The optional sequential hosted worker invokes this same operation in fresh scopes and does
not apply migrations, activate producer publication or discover modules.

O1 does not implement an inbox. The owner prefers durable intake followed by independent
transactional processing: retain a complete envelope, commit intake, acknowledge transport,
then later commit handler effects/completion/outgoing work together. That protocol needs its
own reviewed interface and real two-module broker/database recovery proof. MessageId identifies
delivery; correlation groups related work and causation identifies immediate cause. They must
not conflate delivery deduplication with semantic business-operation idempotency.

See [the library-local contract](../../src/Rootbolt.Messaging/docs/capabilities.md) and
[dated executions](../reports/outbox1-transactional-dispatch.md). T1 remains event/messaging-free;
the archive, previous migrations, fixtures and existing event checkpoints are preserved.
